This solution will test the https://sdetchallenge.fetch.com/ application

The test will navigate to the https://sdetchallenge.fetch.com/ website.  It will break apart the number of bars into two equal lists to weigh them. If the number of bars is odd it will keep the last bar out of the weighing.  If both sides equal each other on the first pass it will be assumed that the light brick is the one that was kept out.  This process is based on the divide and conquer algorithm.  Based on the results it will take the results of the light bowl and split those into 2 lists.  It will continue to split the bowls and weigh them until there is only one bar in each bowl.  Once the light bar is determined it will select that bar and it will output the alert message, list of weighings, number of weighings, and the number of the light brick.
